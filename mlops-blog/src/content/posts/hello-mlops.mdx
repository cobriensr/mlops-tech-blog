Welcome to Build MLOps! This is where I'll share practical insights from building machine learning systems in production.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be covering:

- **Real-world MLOps patterns** that actually work in production
- **Tool comparisons** based on hands-on experience
- **Architecture decisions** and their trade-offs
- **Cost optimization** strategies for ML infrastructure

## Topics I'll Cover

### Model Deployment
From notebook to production - the right way.

### Monitoring & Observability
Because models drift and things break.

### Infrastructure as Code
Terraform, Kubernetes, and cloud-native ML.

### MLOps Tools
Honest reviews of tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, and more.

## Let's Build Together

Follow along as I share what I've learned from deploying models that serve millions of predictions daily.

Stay tuned for deep dives into:
- Building resilient ML pipelines
- Scaling inference services
- Managing experiment tracking
- And much more!
